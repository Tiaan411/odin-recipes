        <h1>Poached Chicken Breasts</h1>

        <p>This easy poached chicken recipe has much more flavor and a better taste than boiled chicken. 
            If you want to eat more lean protein, give this meal a try. I like to eat it with veggies!</p>

    <h1>Directions</h1>

    <ol>
        <li>Combine chicken stock, water, yellow onion, celery, carrots, tomato paste, salt, 
            peppercorns, and bay leaf in a large pot; bring to a gentle simmer. 
            Decrease heat to medium-low and simmer, checking flavor occasionally, 
            until vegetables are slightly tender, 30 to 45 minutes. </li>
        <li>Bring stock to a boil and add chicken, pouring in more water if chicken isn't completely covered in liquid. 
            Bring poaching liquid to a boil; remove pot from heat and cover tightly with a lid until chicken is no longer pink in center, 
            about 15 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). </li>
    </ol>
