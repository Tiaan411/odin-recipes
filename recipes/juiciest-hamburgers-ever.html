        <h2>How to Grill Hamburgers</h2>

        <p> It couldn't be easier to grill hamburger patties! You'll find the full recipe below, but here's a brief overview of what you can expect:
            Prepare the grill grate by cleaning it and brushing it lightly with oil. Heat a charcoal or gas grill to medium-high heat, 
            then grill the patties on each side (the length of time depends on the level of doneness you're after). If you're making cheeseburgers, 
            add a slice of cheese about a minute before the burger is finished.</p>

        <h2>What Temprature is a Hamburger Done?</h2>

        <p>Hamburger patties are done when a food thermometer inserted into the center reaches 160 degrees F.</p>

        <h2>How Long to Grill Hamburgers?</h2>
